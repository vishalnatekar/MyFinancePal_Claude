## Dev Notes

### Integration with Story 4.1

**Story 4.1** (Expense Splitting Rules Engine) established:
- Complete rules engine with merchant, category, amount threshold, and default rules
- Rule matching service with priority system (src/services/rule-matching-service.ts)
- Rule priority algorithm that selects highest priority matching rule
- Bulk rule application for historical transactions
- Rules are stored in expense_splitting_rules table with fields:
  - id, household_id, rule_name, rule_type, priority
  - merchant_pattern, category_match, min_amount, max_amount
  - split_percentage (JSONB), is_active, created_by, created_at
  - apply_to_existing_transactions flag

**This story (4.2) builds on 4.1 by:**
- Automatically applying rules when new transactions sync (real-time)
- Adding confidence scoring to measure rule match quality
- Providing manual override UI for incorrect categorizations
- Creating review queue for low-confidence categorizations
- Implementing user feedback loop to improve rules

### Real-Time Transaction Categorization

**When transactions sync from TrueLayer:**
1. Transaction is inserted into transactions table
2. Webhook/trigger calls transaction-categorization-service.applyRulesToTransaction()
3. Service queries active rules for transaction's household (if applicable)
4. Service applies rule matching algorithm from Story 4.1
5. Highest priority matching rule is selected
6. Transaction is updated with:
   - splitting_rule_id (UUID of matching rule)
   - is_shared_expense (boolean true/false)
   - shared_with_household_id (UUID if shared)
   - confidence_score (integer 0-100)
   - manual_override (boolean false initially)
7. Notification sent to household members if shared

**Performance Optimization:**
- Rules are cached per household (React Query with 5-min TTL)
- Batch processing during sync (process 50 transactions at once)
- Database transaction for atomicity
- Indexes on household_id, confidence_score, splitting_rule_id

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

**Confidence Score Calculation:**

```typescript
function calculateConfidenceScore(
  transaction: Transaction,
  rule: SplittingRule
): number {
  switch (rule.rule_type) {
    case 'merchant':
      // Exact match = 100, pattern match = 85
      const isExactMatch = transaction.merchant_name === rule.merchant_pattern.replace('.*', '');
      return isExactMatch ? 100 : 85;

    case 'category':
      // Exact category match = 95
      return 95;

    case 'amount_threshold':
      // Amount threshold = 80 (less certain than merchant/category)
      return 80;

    case 'default':
      // Default rule = 60 (lowest confidence)
      return 60;

    default:
      return 50; // Unknown rule type
  }
}
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- **HIGH (95-100)**: Exact merchant name or category match → Auto-apply, no review needed
- **MEDIUM (70-94)**: Pattern match or amount threshold → Auto-apply, low-priority review
- **LOW (50-69)**: Default rule or uncertain match → Auto-apply but flag for review
- **NONE (0-49)**: No matching rule → Add to uncategorized queue immediately

**UI Display:**
- HIGH: Green checkmark badge "Automatically categorized"
- MEDIUM: Yellow star badge "Categorized by rule"
- LOW: Orange warning badge "Needs review"
- NONE: Red alert badge "Uncategorized"

### Transaction Splitting (Partially Shared)

**Use Case:**
User buys groceries (£80) and toiletries (£20) in same Tesco transaction.
- Groceries are shared (£80 split 50/50)
- Toiletries are personal (£20 not shared)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
interface TransactionSplit {
  personal_amount: number; // Amount that is NOT shared
  shared_amount: number; // Amount that IS shared
  split_percentage: Record<string, number>; // How shared amount is split
}

// Example:
{
  personal_amount: 20.00,
  shared_amount: 80.00,
  split_percentage: {
    "user_id_1": 50,
    "user_id_2": 50
  }
}
```

**Database Schema Addition:**
- Add split_details JSONB column to transactions table
- Validation: personal_amount + shared_amount must equal transaction.amount
- Settlement calculations must use split_details.shared_amount instead of full amount

**UI Flow:**
1. User clicks "Split Transaction" button on transaction detail
2. Modal opens with transaction amount (£100)
3. User enters shared amount (£80) and personal amount (£20)
4. Validation: £80 + £20 = £100 ✓
5. User selects split percentage for shared portion (50/50)
6. Save updates split_details and is_shared_expense = true

### Manual Override System

**Override Scenarios:**
1. Rule incorrectly categorizes transaction as shared (should be personal)
2. Rule applies wrong split percentage (should be 60/40 not 50/50)
3. User wants to share transaction that wasn't matched by any rule

**Override Implementation:**

```typescript
interface TransactionOverride {
  transaction_id: string;
  original_rule_id: string | null; // What rule originally applied
  override_by: string; // User ID who made override
  override_at: string; // Timestamp
  new_is_shared_expense: boolean;
  new_split_percentage: Record<string, number> | null;
  override_reason: string | null; // Optional user comment
}
```

**API Endpoint:**
- POST /api/transactions/[id]/override
- Request body: { is_shared_expense, split_percentage, reason }
- Updates transaction and sets manual_override = true
- Stores override history in transaction_overrides table (new table)
- Sets confidence_score = 100 (manual decision is most confident)
- Sends notification: "[User] changed categorization for [Transaction]"

**UI Components:**
- "Override Rule" button in transaction detail view
- Shows current rule: "Currently shared 50/50 by rule: Groceries 50/50"
- Modal allows changing to: "Personal", "Shared (custom %)", "Split"
- Shows override history: "Changed by [User] on [Date]: Personal → Shared 50/50"

### Uncategorized Transaction Queue

**Queue Criteria:**
Transaction appears in queue if:
1. splitting_rule_id IS NULL (no rule matched)
2. confidence_score < 70 (low confidence)
3. manual_override = false (not yet reviewed)

**Queue Features:**
- Shows count in household dashboard: "12 transactions need review"
- Dedicated page: `/household/[id]/review-transactions`
- Table columns: Date, Merchant, Amount, Suggested Rule (if any), Actions
- Quick actions: "Accept", "Reject", "Edit", "Mark as Personal"
- Bulk actions: "Apply [Rule] to all", "Mark all as personal"
- Filter by: Date range, Amount range, Merchant
- Sort by: Confidence score (lowest first), Date (newest first), Amount (highest first)

**Queue Processing:**
- User reviews transaction
- User accepts suggestion → Apply rule, set confidence_score = 100
- User rejects suggestion → Add to override with manual categorization
- Transaction removed from queue once categorized

### User Feedback Loop

**Goal:** Learn from user overrides to improve rule suggestions

**Feedback Tracking:**

Create rule_feedback table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE rule_feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id),
  rule_id UUID REFERENCES expense_splitting_rules(id),
  household_id UUID REFERENCES households(id),
  user_action TEXT CHECK (user_action IN ('accepted', 'rejected', 'overridden')),
  original_confidence_score INTEGER,
  override_details JSONB, -- What user changed to
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Analytics Queries:**

```typescript
// Rule acceptance rate
SELECT
  rule_id,
  rule_name,
  COUNT(*) as applications,
  SUM(CASE WHEN user_action = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as accepted,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN user_action = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as acceptance_rate
FROM rule_feedback
GROUP BY rule_id, rule_name
ORDER BY acceptance_rate DESC;

// Common override patterns
SELECT
  rule_id,
  override_details->>'new_split_percentage' as new_split,
  COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM rule_feedback
WHERE user_action = 'overridden'
GROUP BY rule_id, override_details->>'new_split_percentage'
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

**Rule Improvement Suggestions:**

Display in rule management page:
- "This rule has been overridden 15 times in the last 30 days"
- "Common override: Users change to 60/40 instead of 50/50"
- "Suggestion: Update default split percentage to 60/40"
- "Improve Rule" button that pre-fills form with suggested changes

**Future Enhancement (Phase 2):**
- Machine learning model trained on feedback data
- Suggests new rules based on override patterns
- Auto-adjusts rule priority based on acceptance rate

### Data Models

**Transactions Table Extensions:**

New columns to add in migration 015:
```sql
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD COLUMN confidence_score INTEGER DEFAULT NULL CHECK (confidence_score >= 0 AND confidence_score <= 100),
ADD COLUMN manual_override BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN original_rule_id UUID REFERENCES expense_splitting_rules(id),
ADD COLUMN split_details JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_confidence_score ON transactions(household_id, confidence_score);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_manual_override ON transactions(household_id, manual_override);
```

**New Tables:**

```sql
-- Transaction override history
CREATE TABLE transaction_overrides (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id) NOT NULL,
  original_rule_id UUID REFERENCES expense_splitting_rules(id),
  override_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
  override_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  old_is_shared_expense BOOLEAN,
  new_is_shared_expense BOOLEAN,
  old_split_percentage JSONB,
  new_split_percentage JSONB,
  override_reason TEXT
);

-- Rule feedback tracking
CREATE TABLE rule_feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id) NOT NULL,
  rule_id UUID REFERENCES expense_splitting_rules(id),
  household_id UUID REFERENCES households(id) NOT NULL,
  user_action TEXT CHECK (user_action IN ('accepted', 'rejected', 'overridden')) NOT NULL,
  original_confidence_score INTEGER,
  override_details JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE transaction_overrides ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE rule_feedback ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY transaction_overrides_household_access ON transaction_overrides
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM transactions t
      JOIN user_households uh ON t.user_id = uh.user_id
      WHERE t.id = transaction_overrides.transaction_id
      AND uh.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY rule_feedback_household_access ON rule_feedback
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_households uh
      WHERE uh.household_id = rule_feedback.household_id
      AND uh.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

  - Action: "Improve Rule" button

### Performance Considerations

**Real-Time Categorization:**
- Rule matching must complete within 500ms per transaction
- Cache active household rules in memory (React Query 5-min TTL)
- Use database indexes on household_id, is_active for rule queries
- Batch process during sync (50 transactions at once)
- Use database transactions for atomicity

**Uncategorized Queue:**
- Paginate results (50 per page)
- Index on confidence_score for fast filtering
- Cache queue count for dashboard display
- Lazy load transaction details on expand

**Feedback Analytics:**
- Pre-calculate rule performance metrics (cron job nightly)
- Store in rule_performance table for fast display
- Don't recalculate on every page load

### Technical Constraints

**Authentication** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- All API routes must call authenticateRequest() helper
- Verify transaction ownership or household membership

**Input Validation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Zod schemas for override/split requests
- Validate split amounts sum to transaction total
- Validate split_percentage sums to 100%

**Database Access** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Supabase client with RLS policies
- Ensure transactions only visible to owner/household members

**State Management** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use React Query for transaction categorization state
- Optimistic updates for override actions
- Invalidate transaction queries after categorization changes

### Integration with Story 4.3

**Bridge to Settlement Calculation:**
This story (4.2) provides automatic categorization. Story 4.3 will:
- Calculate settlement balances from categorized shared transactions
- Use split_details for partially shared expense calculations
- Build settlement dashboard showing who owes whom
- Implement "mark as settled" functionality

**For this story (4.2), ensure:**
- Shared transactions are correctly identified (is_shared_expense = true)
- Split percentages are accurate (for settlement math)
- Manual overrides are tracked (for settlement disputes)
- Transaction categorization is complete before settlement calculation

  - `transaction-categorization-service.test.ts` - Test auto-categorization logic
  - `rule-matching-service.test.ts` - EXTEND (test confidence scoring)
- Location: `tests/api/transactions/`
- Test files:
  - `override.test.ts` - Test override endpoint
  - `split.test.ts` - Test split endpoint

**Integration Tests:**
- Test real-time categorization on transaction sync
- Test batch categorization with multiple transactions
- Test override history tracking
- Test RLS policies for override/feedback tables

**E2E Tests:**
- Location: `tests/e2e/transactions/`
- Test file: `automatic-categorization.spec.ts`
- Test complete workflow:
  1. User syncs account (transactions imported)
  2. Verify transactions automatically categorized by rules
  3. User sees "Shared" badge on grocery transaction
  4. User clicks "Override" and changes to Personal
  5. Verify transaction updated and removed from household view
  6. User creates new transaction with no matching rule
  7. Verify transaction appears in uncategorized queue
  8. User reviews and accepts suggested rule
  9. Verify transaction categorized and removed from queue
  10. User splits transaction (£80 shared, £20 personal)
  11. Verify split details saved and settlement calculation correct

**Performance Tests:**
- Test categorization with 1000+ transactions in single sync
- Verify rule matching completes within 500ms per transaction
- Test batch categorization with 500 uncategorized transactions
- Profile database query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

**Edge Cases to Test:**
- Transaction with no matching rule (should have confidence_score = null)
- Default rule only (should have low confidence ~60)
- Multiple overrides on same transaction (history tracking)
- Split transaction where amounts don't sum to total (validation error)
- Override by non-household member (authorization error)
- Confidence score calculation for each rule type
- Race condition: Two users override same transaction simultaneously
