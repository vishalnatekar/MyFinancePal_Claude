# Story 4.1: Expense Splitting Rules Engine

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** household member,
**I want** to configure rules for automatically splitting shared expenses,
**so that** I don't have to manually categorize every transaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Rule creation interface for merchant-based splitting ("All Tesco = shared")
2. Category-based rules (utilities, groceries) with configurable percentages
3. Amount threshold rules for high-value transactions
4. Default splitting percentages (50/50, custom ratios)
5. Rule priority system when multiple rules match a transaction
6. Bulk rule application to historical transactions
7. Rule templates for common household scenarios
8. Rule testing interface showing which transactions would match
9. Household-wide rule visibility and collaboration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 3.2** (Transaction Privacy Controls) established:
- Transaction-level sharing via `shared_with_household_id` field
- Transactions table has `splitting_rule_id` field (UUID, nullable)
- Manual transaction sharing as foundation for automated rules

**Story 3.3** (Household Dashboard) established:
- Household member tracking with user details
- Shared transaction aggregation and display

**Story 3.4** (Household Notification System) established:
- Notification system for household events
- Can trigger notifications when rules auto-share transactions

### Core Rules Engine Design

**Rule Types:**
1. **Merchant-based** (`rule_type = 'merchant'`)
   - Match by merchant_pattern (regex or exact)
   - Example: "All Tesco transactions" → `merchant_pattern: "Tesco.*"`
   - Most common rule type for recurring expenses

2. **Category-based** (`rule_type = 'category'`)
   - Match by transaction category
   - Example: "All Groceries" → `category_match: "groceries"`
   - Requires accurate transaction categorization

3. **Amount threshold** (`rule_type = 'amount_threshold'`)
   - Match by transaction amount range
   - Example: "Transactions > £100" → `min_amount: 100.00`
   - Useful for large purchases

4. **Default rule** (`rule_type = 'default'`)
   - Catch-all rule with lowest priority
   - Applied when no other rules match
   - Example: "Share everything 50/50" or "Keep everything private"

**Rule Priority System:**
- Priority 1 = highest (applied first)
- Priority 2, 3, 4... = lower priorities
- When multiple rules match, highest priority wins
- Default rules always have lowest priority (e.g., priority 999)
- Users can reorder rules via drag-and-drop

**Rule Matching Algorithm:**
```typescript
function findMatchingRules(transaction: Transaction, rules: SplittingRule[]): SplittingRule | null {
  // Sort rules by priority ascending (1 = highest)
  const sortedRules = rules
    .filter(r => r.is_active)
    .sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);

  for (const rule of sortedRules) {
    if (ruleMatches(rule, transaction)) {
      return rule;
    }
  }

  return null; // No matching rule
}

function ruleMatches(rule: SplittingRule, transaction: Transaction): boolean {
  switch (rule.rule_type) {
    case 'merchant':
      return new RegExp(rule.merchant_pattern).test(transaction.merchant_name);
    case 'category':
      return rule.category_match === transaction.category;
    case 'amount_threshold':
      return transaction.amount >= rule.min_amount &&
             (rule.max_amount === null || transaction.amount <= rule.max_amount);
    case 'default':
      return true; // Default rule matches everything
    default:
      return false;
  }
}
```

    id: 'groceries-5050',
    name: 'Split Groceries 50/50',

    rule_type: 'category',
    default_config: {
      rule_name: 'Groceries 50/50',
      category_match: 'groceries',
      split_percentage: {}, // Populated with household members
      priority: 10,
    },
    example_transactions: ['Tesco', 'Sainsbury\'s', 'Waitrose', 'Asda'],
  },
  {
    id: 'utilities-custom',
    name: 'Split Utilities by Custom Ratio',
    description: 'Share utility bills with custom percentages per person',
    rule_type: 'category',
    default_config: {
      rule_name: 'Utilities Split',
      category_match: 'utilities',
      split_percentage: {}, // User customizes
      priority: 15,
    },
    example_transactions: ['Thames Water', 'British Gas', 'EDF Energy'],
  },

    rule_type: 'amount_threshold',
    default_config: {
      rule_name: 'Large Purchases',
      min_amount: 100.00,
      split_percentage: {}, // Populated with 50/50
      priority: 5,
    },
    example_transactions: ['John Lewis £250', 'Currys £180'],
  },
  {
    id: 'supermarket-merchant',
    name: 'Share All Supermarket Purchases',
    description: 'Match all major UK supermarkets automatically',
    rule_type: 'merchant',
    default_config: {
      rule_name: 'Supermarkets',
      merchant_pattern: '(Tesco|Sainsbury|Asda|Morrisons|Waitrose|Aldi|Lidl).*',
      split_percentage: {},
      priority: 20,
    },
    example_transactions: ['Tesco Extra', 'Sainsbury\'s Local'],

  {
    id: 'default-share-all',
    name: 'Share Everything (Default Rule)',
    description: 'Share all transactions that don\'t match other rules',
    rule_type: 'default',
    default_config: {
      rule_name: 'Default - Share All',
      split_percentage: {},
      priority: 999, // Lowest priority
    },
    example_transactions: ['Any transaction not covered by other rules'],
  },
];
```

### Split Percentage Validation

**Business Rules:**
- Split percentages must sum to exactly 100%
- Each household member can have 0-100% allocation
- Minimum 1 member must have > 0% (can't split 0% to everyone)
- Percentages stored as integers (e.g., 50 = 50%)

**Example Configurations:**
```typescript
// 50/50 split between two members
{
  "user_id_1": 50,
  "user_id_2": 50
}

// 60/40 split (maybe one person earns more)
{
  "user_id_1": 60,
  "user_id_2": 40
}

// Three-way split (flatmates)
{
  "user_id_1": 33,
  "user_id_2": 33,
  "user_id_3": 34 // One person gets 34% to sum to 100
}

// One person pays entirely (100%)
{
  "user_id_1": 100,
  "user_id_2": 0
}
```

**Validation Code**:
```typescript
function validateSplitPercentage(split: Record<string, number>, householdMemberIds: string[]): boolean {
  // Check all percentages are 0-100
  const percentages = Object.values(split);
  if (percentages.some(p => p < 0 || p > 100)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check sum equals 100
  const total = percentages.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p, 0);
  if (total !== 100) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check at least one person has > 0%
  if (percentages.every(p => p === 0)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check all user IDs are valid household members
  const invalidUsers = Object.keys(split).filter(id => !householdMemberIds.includes(id));
  if (invalidUsers.length > 0) {
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Bulk Application Logic

**When to Apply Rules to Historical Transactions:**
- User explicitly triggers bulk application
- After rule creation, show prompt: "Apply to past 30 days?" (optional)
- Apply only to transactions that don't already have a splitting_rule_id
- Don't override manual transaction sharing (check shared_by field)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
async function applyRuleToBulkTransactions(
  ruleId: string,
  householdId: string,
  startDate: string,
  endDate: string
): Promise<BulkApplicationResult> {
  const rule = await getRule(ruleId);
  const transactions = await getEligibleTransactions(householdId, startDate, endDate);

  let affected = 0;
  let totalAmount = 0;
  const errors: string[] = [];

  for (const tx of transactions) {
    if (ruleMatches(rule, tx)) {
      try {
        await updateTransaction(tx.id, {
          splitting_rule_id: rule.id,
          is_shared_expense: true,
          shared_with_household_id: householdId,
        });
        affected++;
        totalAmount += Math.abs(tx.amount);
      } catch (error) {
        errors.push(`Failed to apply rule to transaction ${tx.id}: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }
  }

  return {
    rule_id: ruleId,
    affected_transaction_count: affected,
    total_amount_affected: totalAmount,
    errors,
  };
}
```

### Rule Conflict Detection

**Conflict Scenarios:**
1. **Overlapping merchant patterns**: `"Tesco.*"` and `"Tesco Express.*"`
2. **Overlapping amount ranges**: `min: 50, max: 150` and `min: 100, max: 200`
3. **Category + Merchant overlap**: Category="groceries" + Merchant="Tesco"

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Priority system handles conflicts (highest priority wins)
- Warn user when creating overlapping rules
- Show "This rule may conflict with [Rule Name]" message
- Suggest increasing priority if intentional override

- "Refine Rule" button to adjust criteria

**Rule Template Gallery**:
- Grid of template cards with icon, name, description
- "Use Template" button per card
- Customization modal after selection
- Preview of what the rule will do

### Performance Considerations

**Rule Matching Optimization:**
- Cache active rules per household (5-minute TTL)
- Pre-compile regex patterns for merchant rules
- Index transactions by merchant_name and category for fast queries
- Limit rule matching to active rules only

**Bulk Application Optimization:**
- Process in batches of 100 transactions
- Use database transactions for atomicity
- Show progress bar during bulk operations
- Allow cancellation of long-running bulk applications

**Conflict Detection:**
- Only check for conflicts when creating/updating rules
- Cache conflict analysis results
- Don't block rule creation, just warn user

### Technical Constraints

**Authentication** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- All API routes must call authenticateRequest() helper
- Verify household membership before rule operations

**Input Validation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Zod schemas for rule creation/update
- Validate regex patterns (catch invalid patterns)
- Validate split_percentage sums to 100%

**Database Access** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Supabase client with RLS policies
- Ensure rules only visible to household members

**State Management** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Zustand or React Query for rules state
- Optimistic updates for priority reordering

### Integration with Story 4.2

**Bridge to Automatic Categorization:**
This story (4.1) creates the rules engine. Story 4.2 will:
- Automatically apply rules when new transactions sync
- Add real-time rule matching on transaction insert
- Implement confidence scoring for rule matches
- Add manual override UI for incorrect matches

**For this story (4.1), focus on:**
- Rule creation and management UI
- Manual bulk application to historical transactions
- Testing interface to preview rule effects

### Testing

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

**Frontend Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/components/rules/`
- Test files:
  - `SplittingRulesList.test.tsx` - Test rule display and priority reordering
  - `CreateRuleForm.test.tsx` - Test form validation and submission
  - `SplitPercentageSelector.test.tsx` - Test percentage sum validation

**Backend Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/services/`
- Test files:
  - `rule-matching-service.test.ts` - Test rule matching logic with various transaction types
- Location: `tests/api/households/`
- Test files:
  - `rules.test.ts` - Test CRUD operations for rules
  - `rule-application.test.ts` - Test bulk application logic

**Integration Tests**:
- Test rule priority resolution with multiple matching rules
- Test bulk application affecting multiple transactions
- Test RLS policies for rule access

**E2E Tests**:
- Location: `tests/e2e/rules/`
- Test file: `expense-splitting-rules.spec.ts`
- Test complete workflow:
  1. User navigates to household rules page
  2. User creates merchant-based rule for "Tesco"
  3. User sets 50/50 split between two members
  4. User tests rule (sees matching transactions)
  5. User applies rule to last 30 days
  6. Verify transactions now have splitting_rule_id set
  7. User creates second rule with higher priority
  8. Verify priority system works correctly
  9. User drags rule to reorder priority
  10. User uses template to create utilities rule

**Edge Cases to Test**:
- Rule with invalid regex pattern
- Split percentages summing to 99% or 101%
- Two rules with same priority
- Bulk application to 0 matching transactions
- Deactivating rule doesn't affect already-applied transactions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **strong architectural design** with excellent separation of concerns across database, service, validation, API, and UI layers. The rule matching algorithm is well-designed with priority-based resolution and extensible rule types. Code quality is generally high with clear naming, comprehensive documentation, and proper type safety.

**However, there are CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES** that prevent production deployment:

1. **Database migration not applied** - 20+ TypeScript compilation errors
2. **ReDoS security vulnerability** - Unvalidated user regex patterns
3. **Insufficient test coverage** - Missing component, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Tests disabled** - Test suite not running
5. **Missing UI page** - No page.tsx for rules management route

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** due to blocking TypeScript compilation errors. The codebase cannot be safely refactored until the database schema is synchronized with the implementation.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - Proper type sharing via `src/types/`
  - Service layer pattern correctly implemented
  - Zod validation on all endpoints
  - RLS policies enforced
  - File and component naming conventions followed
  - Biome linter passes with no errors

- **Project Structure**: ✗ CONCERNS
  - API routes follow RESTful conventions ✓
  - Components organized by feature ✓
  - Missing page file for `/household/[id]/rules` route ✗
  - Only 2 of 9 planned UI components implemented ✗

- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ FAIL
  - Unit tests exist for rule matching service ✓
  - Component tests missing (0 of 3 required) ✗
  - API integration tests missing (0 of 6 required) ✗
  - E2E workflow test missing ✗
  - Test suite disabled in package.json ✗

- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - ACs 2, 3, 4: Fully implemented and tested ✓
  - ACs 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: Implemented but untested ⚠️

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Fix Before Production):**

- [ ] Apply database migration 014 to Supabase
- [ ] Regenerate TypeScript types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.ts`
- [ ] Fix ReDoS vulnerability by adding regex validation (use 'safe-regex' library or limit complexity)
- [ ] Add component tests for `SplittingRulesList.tsx` and `CreateRuleDialog.tsx`
- [ ] Add API integration tests for all 6 rule endpoints
- [ ] Add E2E test for complete rule creation and application workflow
- [ ] Re-enable test suite and ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Create missing page file: `src/app/(dashboard)/household/[id]/rules/page.tsx`

**High Priority (Should Address):**

- [ ] Add rate limiting to rule creation and testing endpoints
- [ ] Implement caching for active household rules (Redis with 5-min TTL)
- [ ] Optimize bulk application with batch updates instead of N+1 queries
- [ ] Add pagination to rule testing endpoint (currently loads all 30-day transactions)
- [ ] Implement audit logging for rule modifications
- [ ] Add RLS policy tests to verify household member access controls

**Medium Priority (Nice to Have):**

- [ ] Complete advanced UI features: drag-and-drop priority reordering, split percentage selector, template gallery
- [ ] Add retry logic for bulk application failures
- [ ] Implement idempotency keys for rule creation
- [ ] Add transaction rollback for partial bulk application failures
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to constants (priority 999, 30-day lookback)
- [ ] Add test for priority ties (same priority value)
- [ ] Add test for concurrent rule updates

### Security Review

**🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**

**ReDoS Vulnerability (CVE Risk):**
- **Location**: `src/services/rule-matching-service.ts:69`
- **Issue**: User-provided merchant patterns are compiled as regex without timeout or complexity limits
- **Risk**: Catastrophic backtracking patterns can cause denial of service
- **Example**: Pattern like `(a+)+b` against string "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac" causes exponential time
- **Mitigation**: Add regex validation using 'safe-regex' library or limit pattern length/nesting depth

**Other Security Concerns:**
- No rate limiting on rule creation/testing endpoints (abuse potential)
- No audit logging for rule modifications (compliance issue)
- Bulk operations lack additional confirmation (any household member can modify all transactions)

**Positive Security Practices:**
- RLS policies properly implemented ✓
- Authentication required on all routes ✓
- Household membership verification ✓
- Split percentage user IDs validated ✓

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Issues Identified:**

1. **No caching** - Active rules fetched from database on every match (high latency)
2. **N+1 queries** - Bulk application updates transactions individually (src/app/api/households/[id]/rules/[ruleId]/apply/route.ts:156-180)
3. **Full table scan** - Rule testing queries all 30-day transactions without pagination
4. **No merchant_name index** - Regex matching will be slow on large datasets
5. **Synchronous bulk processing** - Blocks request thread, could timeout

**Recommended Optimizations:**
- Implement Redis caching for household rules (5-minute TTL)
- Batch transaction updates using Supabase bulk API
- Add pagination to rule testing endpoint (max 100 results per page)
- Consider async job queue for bulk operations (use Supabase Edge Functions)
- Add database index on `transactions.merchant_name` for faster regex matching

### Files Modified During Review

**No files were modified** during this review due to blocking compilation errors. Refactoring and improvements should be applied after resolving the critical database migration issue.

### Gate Status

**Gate: FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/4.1-expense-splitting-rules-engine.yml

**Quality Score: 50/100**

**Blocking Issues:**
- Database migration not applied (20+ TypeScript errors)
- ReDoS security vulnerability
- Missing test coverage (component, integration, E2E)
- Tests disabled in package.json
- Missing UI page file

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

This story **CANNOT be marked as Done** until all critical issues are resolved:
1. Database migration must be applied
2. TypeScript compilation errors must be fixed
3. ReDoS vulnerability must be patched
4. Test suite must be re-enabled and passing
5. Missing page file must be created

The implementation quality is strong, but the incomplete deployment state and security vulnerabilities make this unsuitable for production. Recommend moving back to **In Progress** status.

**Story owner must address all critical items before requesting re-review.**
