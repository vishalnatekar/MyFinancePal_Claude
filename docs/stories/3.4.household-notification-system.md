## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 3.1** (Household Creation and Invitation System) established:
- Resend email service integration (src/lib/email-service.ts, src/lib/email-templates.ts)
- Email sending is non-blocking (don't fail operations if email fails)
- Environment variables: RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM_EMAIL

**Story 3.2** (Transaction Privacy Controls) established:
- Transaction sharing via shared_with_household_id field
- Real-time Supabase subscriptions for shared transactions
- Transaction privacy: only shared transactions visible to household

**Story 3.3** (Household Dashboard and Shared View) established:
- Household member tracking with roles
- Activity feed showing household events
- Real-time updates for household data

### Core Notification Model

**Notification Types:**
1. **transaction_shared** - Member shared new transaction
2. **large_transaction** - Shared transaction exceeds threshold
3. **member_joined** - New member accepted invitation
4. **member_left** - Member left household
5. **weekly_summary** - Weekly digest email (email only, no in-app)

**Notification Channels:**
- **In-app**: Real-time notifications in UI (NotificationCenter dropdown)
- **Email**: Immediate or batched emails via Resend
- **Push**: Browser push notifications (AC6 - future enhancement, optional for this story)

**Privacy Model:**
Notifications must NOT expose sensitive information:
- ✅ Show: Transaction amount, merchant name, member name
- ❌ Hide: Account names, account balances, full transaction descriptions
- Example: "John shared £45.50 at Tesco" (good) vs "John shared £45.50 from Barclays Checking" (bad)

### Data Models

**Notifications Table** (New - to be created):
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.notifications (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('transaction_shared', 'large_transaction', 'member_joined', 'member_left')),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  household_id UUID REFERENCES households(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  recipient_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  actor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id), -- Who triggered the notification
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  metadata JSONB, -- Additional context (transaction_id, amount, etc.)
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_recipient_unread ON notifications(recipient_id, is_read, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_household ON notifications(household_id, created_at DESC);
```

### Notification Creation Service

**Location**: `src/services/notification-service.ts`

**Core Methods**:
```typescript
export const notificationService = {
  // Create in-app notification
  async createNotification(
    type: NotificationType,
    householdId: string,
    recipientIds: string[],
    actorId: string,
    metadata: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Generate title and message based on type and metadata
    // Insert notifications for each recipient (skip if in_app_notifications = false)
    // Log failures but don't throw errors
  },

  // Send email notification
  async sendEmailNotification(
    type: NotificationType,
    recipientEmail: string,
    householdId: string,
    metadata: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Check if recipient has email_notifications enabled
    // Select appropriate email template
    // Send via Resend (non-blocking)
    // Log failures
  },

  // Generate weekly summary for household
  async generateWeeklySummary(householdId: string): Promise<WeeklySummary> {
    // Query shared transactions from past 7 days
    // Calculate member contributions
    // Aggregate by category
    // Return structured summary data
  },
};
```

### Notification Triggers

**When to Create Notifications:**

1. **Transaction Shared** (Story 3.2 integration):
   - Trigger: After successful transaction sharing in PUT /api/transactions/[id]/sharing
   - Recipients: All household members except the actor
   - In-app: Always create
   - Email: Only if transaction amount >= user's threshold
   - Message: "John shared £45.50 at Tesco"

2. **Bulk Transaction Sharing** (Story 3.2 integration):
   - Trigger: After successful bulk sharing in POST /api/transactions/bulk-sharing
   - Batching: Group into single notification "John shared 5 transactions (£234.50 total)"
   - Recipients: All household members except the actor
   - In-app: Always create batched notification
   - Email: Only if combined total >= threshold

3. **Member Joined** (Story 3.1 integration):
   - Trigger: After successful invitation acceptance in POST /api/households/invite/[token]/accept
   - Recipients: All existing household members
   - In-app: Always create
   - Email: Always send
   - Message: "Sarah joined your household"

4. **Member Left**:
   - Trigger: When implementing leave functionality (future story)
   - Recipients: Remaining household members
   - In-app: Always create
   - Email: Always send
   - Message: "John left your household"

5. **Weekly Summary**:
   - Trigger: Cron job every Sunday 6 PM UTC
   - Recipients: Members with weekly_digest_enabled = true
   - Email only (no in-app notification)

### Notification Batching Logic

**Problem**: Bulk transaction sharing could create spam (e.g., user shares 50 transactions → 50 notifications)

**Solution**: 5-minute batching window
- When bulk share occurs, create single batched notification
- Message format: "John shared 15 transactions totaling £450.75"
- Metadata includes: transaction_ids array, total_amount, count
- Email: Send single email instead of 15 separate emails

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In POST /api/transactions/bulk-sharing after success
if (successCount > 0) {
  const totalAmount = successfulTransactions.reduce((sum, tx) => sum + tx.amount, 0);

  await notificationService.createNotification(
    'transaction_shared',
    householdId,
    recipientIds,
    userId,
    {
      count: successCount,
      total_amount: totalAmount,
      transaction_ids: successfulTransactions.map(tx => tx.id),
    }
  );
}
```

### Email Templates

**Location**: `src/lib/email-templates.ts`

**Templates to Create:**

1. **Large Transaction Alert**:
   - Subject: "🔔 Large shared expense in [Household Name]"
   - Body: "[Member Name] shared a £[amount] transaction at [Merchant]"
   - CTA: "View in Dashboard" button linking to household page
   - Footer: Unsubscribe link, preference settings link

2. **Member Joined**:
   - Subject: "👋 [Member Name] joined [Household Name]"
   - Body: "[Member Name] accepted your invitation and joined the household"
   - CTA: "View Household" button
   - Footer: Standard

3. **Weekly Household Summary**:
   - Subject: "📊 Your weekly household summary for [Household Name]"
   - Body sections:
     - Total shared spending this week: £[amount]
     - Member contributions breakdown (table)
     - Top spending categories (list)
     - Recent activity highlights
   - CTA: "View Full Dashboard" button
   - Footer: Unsubscribe link (disable weekly digest)

**Email Template Structure** (Resend HTML):
```typescript
export const largeTransactionEmailTemplate = (data: {
  recipientName: string;
  householdName: string;
  actorName: string;
  amount: number;
  merchant: string;
  dashboardUrl: string;
  unsubscribeUrl: string;
}) => `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Large Transaction Alert</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 20px;">

</html>
`;
```

### Real-time Notifications

**Supabase Real-time Subscription**:
```typescript
// In src/hooks/use-notifications.ts
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel(`notifications-${userId}`)
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'notifications',
      filter: `recipient_id=eq.${userId}`
    }, handleNewNotification)
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [userId]);

function handleNewNotification(payload: any) {
  // Update notifications state
  // Increment unread count
  // Show toast notification (optional)
  // Play notification sound (optional)
}
```

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Verify cron secret token
  const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
  if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  // Generate and send summaries
  const households = await getActiveHouseholds();
  for (const household of households) {
    const summary = await notificationService.generateWeeklySummary(household.id);
    await sendWeeklySummaryEmails(household, summary);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```

### UI/UX Specifications

**NotificationCenter Component**:
- Bell icon in header (top right)
- Unread count badge (red circle with number)
- Dropdown on click showing latest 10 notifications
- "Mark all as read" button
- "View all" link to dedicated notifications page (future)
- Real-time updates (new notifications appear instantly)

**Notification Item Display**:
- Avatar of actor (who triggered notification)
- Title in bold (e.g., "Transaction Shared")
- Message (e.g., "John shared £45.50 at Tesco")
- Relative timestamp (e.g., "5 minutes ago")
- Unread indicator (blue dot)
- Click to mark as read and navigate to relevant page

**Notification Preferences UI**:
- Section in household settings page
- Toggle switches for email/in-app notifications
- Slider with currency formatting for threshold (£10 - £500)
- Weekly digest toggle with description
- Save button (shows success toast)
- Preview text: "You will receive notifications when..."

### Technical Constraints

**Authentication** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- All API routes must call authenticateRequest() helper
- Use Supabase Auth for JWT validation

**Input Validation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Zod schemas for preference updates
- Validate threshold range (10-1000)
- Validate notification type enum

**Database Access** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use Supabase client with RLS policies
- RLS ensures users only see their own notifications

**State Management** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Consider creating notification-store.ts with Zustand for notification state
- Or use React Query for server state management

**Email Service** [Source: Story 3.1]:
- Use existing Resend integration
- Non-blocking email sends (don't fail operations if email fails)
- Log email failures for monitoring

### Performance Considerations

**Database Query Optimization**:
- Index on (recipient_id, is_read, created_at DESC) for fast unread queries
- Index on (household_id, created_at DESC) for household-filtered queries
- Paginate notifications list (limit 20 per page)

**Real-time Subscription Optimization**:
- Subscribe only to user's own notifications (scoped by recipient_id)
- Debounce rapid notification inserts (500ms) to prevent UI thrashing
- Unsubscribe when component unmounts

**Email Sending**:
- Use background queue for email sending (don't block API responses)
- Batch weekly summaries (send in chunks of 100, sleep between)
- Rate limit Resend API calls to stay within limits

**Notification Batching**:
- 5-minute window for bulk transaction shares
- Combine notifications for same actor/household in window
- Reduces database inserts and email sends

### Privacy Considerations

**What to Include in Notifications**:
- ✅ Transaction amount and merchant name
- ✅ Member name who performed action
- ✅ Household name
- ✅ Relative timestamps

**What to Exclude**:
- ❌ Account names or account balances
- ❌ Full transaction descriptions (may contain sensitive notes)
- ❌ Other household members' personal information
- ❌ Account institutions or account types

**Example Good Notification**:
- "John shared £45.50 at Tesco in Family Budget"

**Example Bad Notification**:
- "John shared £45.50 from Barclays Checking (balance £1,250) at Tesco"

### Testing

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

**Frontend Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/components/notifications/`
- Test files:
  - `NotificationCenter.test.tsx` - Test dropdown, unread count, mark all read
  - `NotificationList.test.tsx` - Test notification display and filtering
  - `NotificationPreferences.test.tsx` - Test preference form and validation

**Backend Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/api/notifications/`
- Test files:
  - `notifications.test.ts` - Test GET /api/notifications with pagination
  - `preferences.test.ts` - Test GET/PUT preferences endpoints
  - `mark-read.test.ts` - Test mark as read functionality
- Location: `tests/services/`
- Test files:
  - `notification-service.test.ts` - Test notification creation and batching logic

**Integration Tests**:
- Test notification triggers after transaction sharing
- Test email sending integration with Resend
- Test weekly summary generation and email sending
- Test RLS policies for notifications

**E2E Tests**:
- Location: `tests/e2e/notifications/`
- Test file: `household-notifications.spec.ts`
- Test complete workflow:
  1. User A shares transaction in household
  2. User B receives in-app notification (bell icon shows badge)
  3. User B clicks notification center, sees new notification
  4. User B clicks notification, marked as read
  5. User B navigates to settings, updates notification preferences
  6. User A shares large transaction (above threshold)
  7. User B receives email notification
  8. Test weekly summary cron job execution

**Edge Cases to Test**:
- Notification for user who left household (should not create)
- Email preference disabled but in-app enabled (only in-app notification)
- Large transaction exactly at threshold (should notify)
- Bulk share with mix of large and small transactions
- Real-time subscription reconnection after network failure

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation: STRONG PARTIAL COMPLETION (Backend 95%, Frontend 80%)**

The backend architecture is **exceptionally well-implemented** with comprehensive database design, robust API endpoints, elegant service layer patterns, and production-ready email integration. The notification service demonstrates excellent separation of concerns, proper error handling, and privacy-first design principles.

The frontend foundation is solid with well-structured React components and real-time Supabase subscriptions. However, **critical integration gaps** remain that prevent the feature from being fully functional.

**Strengths:**
- Database schema with optimal indexing and comprehensive RLS policies (database/migrations/013_notifications_system.sql:26-149)
- Clean service layer with non-blocking notification creation (src/services/notification-service.ts:136-303)
- Proper user preference management with sensible defaults (src/services/notification-service.ts:82-130)
- Well-designed email templates with unsubscribe functionality (src/lib/email-templates.ts:216-593)
- Real-time notification subscriptions properly implemented (src/hooks/use-notifications.ts:141-219)
- Notification triggers integrated into transaction sharing (src/app/api/transactions/[id]/sharing/route.ts:154-178)
- Vercel cron configured for weekly summaries (vercel.json:46-48)
- Database types properly generated and aligned (src/types/database.ts:466-559)

**Concerns:**
- **CRITICAL**: No notification triggers for bulk transaction sharing (AC 6 - batching requirement not met)
- **CRITICAL**: No notification triggers for member join events (AC 7 partially unmet)
- **HIGH**: No tests whatsoever - Task 8 entirely incomplete (0/7 test suites)
- **HIGH**: NotificationCenter not integrated into Header component (Task 3 incomplete)
- **MEDIUM**: NotificationPreferences component not integrated into household settings page (Task 7 incomplete)

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to kebab-case files, PascalCase components, proper type definitions
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files correctly placed in architecture-defined locations
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **FAIL** - Zero test coverage (expected unit, integration, and E2E tests)
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ **PARTIAL** - 5 of 8 ACs fully met, 3 partially met (see details below)

### Acceptance Criteria Status

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| 1. Real-time notifications for shared transactions | ✓ **PASS** | Notification service + real-time subscription (src/hooks/use-notifications.ts:141-219) |
| 2. Email notifications for large transactions | ✓ **PASS** | Threshold-based email sending (src/services/notification-service.ts:239-297) |
| 3. Weekly household summary emails | ✓ **PASS** | Cron job + email service (src/app/api/cron/send-weekly-summaries/route.ts:21-231) |
| 4. Notification preferences per member | ✓ **PASS** | Preferences API + database table (src/app/api/notifications/preferences/[householdId]/route.ts:34-213) |
| 5. In-app notification center | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Components built but not integrated into Header |
| 6. Notification batching for bulk shares | ✗ **FAIL** | Backend supports batching but no trigger in bulk-sharing route |
| 7. Member join/leave notifications | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Email template exists but no trigger in accept route |
| 8. Privacy-respecting notifications | ✓ **PASS** | Only amount/merchant shown, no account details (src/services/notification-service.ts:29-76) |

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review. Code quality is already high with proper patterns.

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - Security implementation is excellent:
- RLS policies properly restrict notification access (database/migrations/013_notifications_system.sql:66-94)
- Rate limiting implemented on all notification endpoints (30 req/min for reads, 10 req/min for updates)
- Cron endpoint protected with CRON_SECRET bearer token (src/app/api/cron/send-weekly-summaries/route.ts:24-38)
- Input validation using Zod schemas throughout (src/app/api/notifications/preferences/[householdId]/route.ts:19-28)
- Privacy model enforced - no sensitive account data in notifications
- Authentication required on all protected routes via withAuth middleware

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Performance optimization is strong:
- Optimal database indexes for recipient_id and is_read queries (database/migrations/013_notifications_system.sql:26-28)
- Efficient real-time subscription scoped to recipient_id (src/hooks/use-notifications.ts:148-154)
- Non-blocking notification creation (won't fail transaction operations)
- Rate limiting in cron job (100ms between emails, 500ms between households)
- Pagination support in notification list (limit 20-100 items)
- Weekly summary query optimized with proper joins (src/services/notification-service.ts:330-349)

### Critical Implementation Gaps

#### 1. Missing Notification Triggers (HIGH PRIORITY)

**File**: `src/app/api/transactions/bulk-sharing/route.ts`
**Issue**: No notification trigger after bulk transaction sharing
**Required**: Add batched notification after successful bulk share:
```typescript
// After successful bulk share, around line where success is returned
if (successCount > 0 && household_id) {
  const recipients = await getHouseholdRecipients(household_id, user.id);
  const totalAmount = results.filter(r => r.success).reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.amount, 0);
  await createNotification('transaction_shared', household_id, recipients, user.id, {
    count: successCount,
    total_amount: totalAmount,
    transaction_ids: results.filter(r => r.success).map(r => r.transaction_id)
  });
}
```

**File**: `src/app/api/households/invite/[token]/accept/route.ts`
**Issue**: No notification trigger when member joins household
**Required**: Add notification after successful acceptance:
```typescript
// After adding member to household
const recipients = await getHouseholdRecipients(household.id, user.id);
await createNotification('member_joined', household.id, recipients, user.id, {
  member_name: user.user_metadata.full_name || user.email
});
```

#### 2. Missing Component Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**File**: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
**Issue**: NotificationCenter not added to header
**Required**: Import and render NotificationCenter with current user context

**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/household/[id]/settings/page.tsx`
**Issue**: NotificationPreferences component not integrated
**Required**: Add NotificationPreferences section to household settings

#### 3. Zero Test Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKING)

**Missing Test Files** (per Task 8 requirements):
- `tests/services/notification-service.test.ts` - Test batching logic, preference checks
- `tests/api/notifications/notifications.test.ts` - Test pagination, filtering
- `tests/api/notifications/preferences.test.ts` - Test CRUD operations
- `tests/components/notifications/NotificationCenter.test.tsx` - Test dropdown, unread count
- `tests/components/notifications/NotificationList.test.tsx` - Test rendering, mark as read
- `tests/e2e/notifications/household-notifications.spec.ts` - Test complete workflow

### Files Modified During Review

None - no code changes made during review. All findings documented for developer action.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/3.4-household-notification-system.yml
**Risk profile**: Medium-High (strong backend, incomplete integration)
**NFR assessment**: Passed (security, performance, maintainability all strong)

**Primary Concerns:**
1. Zero test coverage blocks production readiness
2. Missing notification triggers for bulk sharing and member joins
3. Frontend components not integrated into application UI

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Must Address Before "Done"**

**Must Fix (Blocking):**
- [ ] Add notification trigger in bulk-sharing route with batched notification
- [ ] Add notification trigger in invite acceptance route
- [ ] Integrate NotificationCenter into Header component
- [ ] Integrate NotificationPreferences into household settings page
- [ ] Add minimum test coverage: notification service unit tests + one E2E test

**Should Fix (Recommended):**
- [ ] Complete comprehensive test suite (Task 8 - all 7 test suites)
- [ ] Add error boundary around NotificationCenter for graceful failure
- [ ] Consider adding toast notifications for new notifications (UX enhancement)

**Nice to Have (Future):**
- [ ] Add notification sound toggle in preferences
- [ ] Implement notification pagination (currently loads 50, could add infinite scroll)
- [ ] Add notification search/filter by type

### Story Owner Decision

Story owner must decide:
1. Accept current state with integration gaps and add follow-up story for completion?
2. Complete integration and minimum testing before marking "Done"?

**Quinn's Recommendation**: Complete the 5 "Must Fix" items (estimated 2-4 hours) to achieve full AC compliance and basic quality gates. The backend foundation is exceptional - don't let missing integration prevent this feature from shipping.
