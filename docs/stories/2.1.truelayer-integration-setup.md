## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 1 completion: Secure authentication foundation established with Google SSO, protected dashboard routes, and user profile management. Authentication middleware and state management are ready for financial account integration.

### TrueLayer API Integration
**API Specification** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#truelayer-api]:
- Base URL: `https://api.truelayer.com`
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with client credentials and user authorization
- Pricing: Pay-as-you-go model (~Â£0.10-0.20 per connection)
- Excellent UK bank coverage including Monzo, Starling, Barclays, HSBC, and all major traditional banks

**Key Endpoints**:
- **Data API:**
  - `POST /auth/token` - Get access token
  - `GET /data/v1/accounts` - Retrieve user bank accounts
  - `GET /data/v1/accounts/{account_id}/transactions` - Fetch transaction history
  - `GET /auth/providers` - List supported UK banks
- **Payments API (Future Epic 3):**
  - `POST /payments/v3/payment-requests` - Initiate bank transfer
  - `GET /payments/v3/payment-requests/{id}` - Get payment status

### OAuth Flow Implementation
**Account Connection Workflow** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-account-connection]:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Frontend: Connect Bank Account
    Frontend->>API: Request TrueLayer Auth
    API->>TrueLayer: Create Auth Session
    TrueLayer->>API: Auth URL
    API->>Frontend: Redirect URL
    Frontend->>TrueLayer: User Authorization
    TrueLayer->>Frontend: Auth Code
    Frontend->>API: Exchange Auth Code
    API->>TrueLayer: Get Access Token
    API->>TrueLayer: Fetch Bank Accounts
    API->>Database: Store Account Data
```

### Data Models
**Financial Account Storage** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#financialaccount]:
```typescript
interface FinancialAccount {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  truelayer_account_id?: string;  // Updated from moneyhub_account_id
  account_type: 'checking' | 'savings' | 'investment' | 'credit';
  account_name: string;
  institution_name: string;
  current_balance: number;
  is_shared: boolean;
  last_synced?: string;
  is_manual: boolean;
}
```

**TrueLayer Integration Service Pattern**:
```typescript
class TrueLayerService {
  private baseUrl = 'https://api.truelayer.com';

  async getAccessToken(): Promise<string> {
    // OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
  }

  async getProviders(): Promise<Institution[]> {
    // Fetch supported UK banks
  }

  async initiateConnection(providerId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Start OAuth flow for bank connection
  }

  async getAccounts(token: string): Promise<TrueLayerAccount[]> {
    // Fetch user's connected bank accounts
  }

  async getTransactions(accountId: string, token: string): Promise<TrueLayerTransaction[]> {
    // Fetch account transaction history
  }
}
```

### Component Specifications
**File Locations Based on Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Account connection pages: `src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/` directory
- Account connection API: `src/app/api/accounts/` directory
- TrueLayer service: `src/services/truelayer-service.ts`
- Account components: `src/components/accounts/` directory
- Account types: `src/types/account.ts` and `src/types/truelayer.ts`

**Connect Account Button Integration**:
Add to existing dashboard with connection to new account management flow.

### API Route Specifications
**Account Connection API Routes**:
- `POST /api/accounts/connect` - Initiate TrueLayer OAuth flow
- `GET /api/accounts/callback` - Handle TrueLayer OAuth callback
- `GET /api/accounts` - List user's connected accounts
- `DELETE /api/accounts/[id]` - Disconnect account
- `POST /api/accounts/sync` - Trigger manual account sync
- `POST /api/accounts/manual` - Add manual account entry

**Error Handling Pattern** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#user-friendly-error-messages]:
```typescript
const TRUELAYER_ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  CONNECTION_FAILED: {
    title: 'Connection Failed',
    message: 'We couldn\'t connect to your bank. Please try again.',
    action: 'Retry Connection',
  },
  INSTITUTION_NOT_SUPPORTED: {
    title: 'Bank Not Supported',
    message: 'We don\'t support this institution yet. You can add accounts manually.',
    action: 'Add Manually',
  },
  EXPIRED_CONNECTION: {
    title: 'Connection Expired',
    message: 'Your bank connection has expired. Please reconnect your account.',
    action: 'Reconnect',
  },
  INVESTMENT_ACCOUNT_DETECTED: {
    title: 'Investment Account Detected',
    message: 'Investment accounts need to be added manually. We\'ll add automated support soon.',
    action: 'Add Manually',
  },
};
```

### Environment Configuration
**Required Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#environment-configuration]:
```bash
# TrueLayer API
TRUELAYER_CLIENT_ID=your_truelayer_client_id
TRUELAYER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_truelayer_client_secret
TRUELAYER_API_URL=https://api.truelayer.com
TRUELAYER_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # sandbox or production

# Already configured from previous stories
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### File Locations
**New files to create**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/page.tsx` - Account management page
- `src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/connect/page.tsx` - Account connection page
- `src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/[id]/page.tsx` - Individual account details

- `database/schema.sql` - Add account connection tables

### Technical Constraints
**Security Requirements**:
- TrueLayer API credentials stored in environment variables only
- Account access tokens encrypted at rest in database
- Use Supabase RLS policies for account data protection
- Implement proper OAuth state validation

**Rate Limiting** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#retry-strategies-and-circuit-breaker-patterns]:
- Implement exponential backoff for TrueLayer API calls
- Add circuit breaker pattern for service protection
- Respect TrueLayer API rate limits

**Error Handling Standards** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#user-friendly-error-messages]:
- Map TrueLayer errors to user-friendly messages
- Provide fallback options (manual entry) for failures
- Implement retry mechanisms for temporary failures

### Investment Account Strategy
**Current Approach**: Manual entry for investment accounts
- Clear messaging that investment accounts need manual entry
- Smooth upgrade path for future automated integration
- Support for major UK brokers: Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell, Interactive Investor, Trading 212

**Future Integration**: Separate story for investment broker integration using Yodlee/Plaid

  - Location: `tests/api/accounts/`
- **Component Tests**: Account connection UI, institution selection
  - Location: `tests/components/accounts/`
- **E2E Tests**: Complete account connection flow
  - Location: `tests/e2e/account-connection.spec.ts`

**Test Scenarios**:
- Successful bank connection via TrueLayer OAuth
- Failed connection with proper error handling
- Institution search and selection
- Manual account entry fallback for investment accounts
- Account sync and status updates

### Database Schema Updates
**Account Connection Tables**:
```sql
-- Add to existing financial_accounts table
ALTER TABLE public.financial_accounts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
  truelayer_connection_id TEXT,        -- Updated from moneyhub_connection_id
  connection_status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (connection_status IN ('active', 'expired', 'failed')),
  encrypted_access_token TEXT;

-- Account sync history
CREATE TABLE public.account_sync_history (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES public.financial_accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sync_status TEXT CHECK (sync_status IN ('success', 'failed', 'in_progress')),
  synced_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  error_message TEXT
);
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** The TrueLayer integration is well-implemented with clean architecture, comprehensive type safety, and solid error handling. However, **critical security vulnerabilities** were identified in the cryptography implementation and authentication handling. These issues have been fixed during the review.

**Strengths:**
- â Excellent service layer abstraction with TrueLayerService class
- â Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for entire TrueLayer API
- â Clean separation of concerns: types, services, API routes, components
- â Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- â Proper OAuth state management with CSRF protection
- â Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- â Database RLS policies properly configured

**Critical Issues Found & Fixed:**
- ð´ **CRITICAL:** Insecure cryptography using deprecated `createCipher/createDecipher` â **FIXED**
- ð´ **CRITICAL:** Development authentication bypass in production code â **FIXED**
- ð  **HIGH:** Hardcoded salt in key derivation â **FIXED**

### Refactoring Performed

#### 1. **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Cryptography Service (src/lib/crypto.ts)**

**Change:** Completely refactored encryption implementation from insecure to secure

**Why:**
- Original code used **deprecated** `createCipher`/`createDecipher` which is cryptographically weak
- No authentication tag validation, allowing tampering
- Hardcoded salt ('myfpencryption') making key derivation predictable
- Declared GCM mode but implemented insecure CBC without proper IV handling

**How:**
- â Upgraded to `createCipheriv`/`createDecipheriv` with explicit IV
- â Implemented proper GCM mode with authentication tag validation
- â Environment-specific salt via `ENCRYPTION_SALT` or hash of `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- â Proper data format: `[IV (16 bytes)][Auth Tag (16 bytes)][Encrypted Data]`
- â Enhanced error messages to detect tampering

**Impact:**
- ð Access tokens now properly encrypted with authenticated encryption
- â ï¸ **ACTION REQUIRED:** Existing encrypted tokens in database must be re-encrypted
- ð **ACTION REQUIRED:** Add `ENCRYPTION_SALT` to environment configuration

**Security Details:**
```typescript
// Before (INSECURE):
crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', key)  // Deprecated, no explicit IV

// After (SECURE):
crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv)  // Modern, explicit IV, auth tag
cipher.getAuthTag()  // Validates data integrity
```

#### 2. **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Authentication Bypass (src/app/api/accounts/connect/route.ts:15-31)**

**Change:** Removed development environment authentication bypass

**Why:**
- Code allowed bypassing authentication with `userId = "debug-user-123"` in development
- This is a **critical security risk** that could accidentally ship to production
- Financial APIs should NEVER have authentication bypasses

**How:**
- â Removed conditional authentication logic
- â Authentication now required in all environments
- â Proper 401 responses for unauthenticated requests

**Impact:**
- ð Eliminates risk of auth bypass in production
- ð§ª Development testing now requires proper auth setup (more realistic)

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** â PASS
  - Types properly shared from `src/types/`
  - Service layer used for all external API calls
  - Environment variables accessed through `config.ts`
  - Proper error handling patterns
  - Zod validation on API endpoints
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces (no `any` types)

- **Project Structure:** â PASS
  - Files in correct locations per `unified-project-structure.md`
  - Proper kebab-case naming for files
  - PascalCase for components and types
  - Service layer properly abstracted

- **Testing Strategy:** ð¡ CONCERNS
  - â Unit tests for TrueLayer service (23 tests)
  - â Integration tests with mocked API
  - â ï¸ **E2E tests missing** for complete OAuth flow
  - â ï¸ **Test URLs incorrect** (using sandbox endpoints in assertions instead of auth.truelayer.com)

- **All ACs Met:** ð¡ MOSTLY (8/9 fully, 1 partially)
  - AC 1-8: â Fully implemented and tested
  - AC 9 (6-hour sync): â ï¸ Service implemented but cron job missing

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed during review:**
- [x] Fixed insecure cryptography implementation (src/lib/crypto.ts)
- [x] Removed authentication bypass vulnerability (src/app/api/accounts/connect/route.ts)
- [x] Added environment-specific salt for key derivation (src/lib/crypto.ts)
- [x] Enhanced error messages to detect data tampering (src/lib/crypto.ts)

**Must complete before production:**
- [ ] Re-encrypt all existing access tokens in database with new crypto implementation
- [ ] Add ENCRYPTION_SALT environment variable to deployment configuration
- [ ] Implement OAuth state cleanup cron job (delete expired states daily)
- [ ] Fix test assertions to use correct TrueLayer endpoint URLs

**Should complete in next sprint:**
- [ ] Add comprehensive E2E tests for complete OAuth flow and sync operations
- [ ] Implement cron job for 6-hour account sync (AC 9)
- [ ] Extract token refresh logic to shared utility function (DRY principle)
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for sync failures and rate limit errors

**Nice to have (future):**
- [ ] Add CDN caching for institution logos
- [ ] Consider extracting validation logic to separate validator classes
- [ ] Add integration test for token refresh error scenarios

### Security Review

**Critical Issues (FIXED during review):**
1. â **Insecure Encryption:** Upgraded from deprecated `createCipher` to secure `createCipheriv` with GCM authentication
2. â **Auth Bypass:** Removed development bypass that could leak to production
3. â **Predictable Salt:** Now uses environment-specific salt for PBKDF2 key derivation

**Remaining Security Concerns:**
1. â ï¸ **Database Token Migration:** Existing encrypted tokens need re-encryption with new crypto
2. â ï¸ **OAuth State Cleanup:** No cron job to cleanup expired states (potential memory leak)
3. â ï¸ **Environment Config:** ENCRYPTION_SALT needs to be added to deployment docs

**Security Strengths:**
- â OAuth CSRF protection via secure state tokens
- â Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (10 req/min connect, 20 req/min callback)
- â RLS policies for financial_accounts table
- â Access tokens encrypted at rest
- â Proper HTTPS enforcement for OAuth redirects
- â One-time use state tokens (consumed after validation)

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Strengths:**
- â Sequential sync with 1-second delay respects API rate limits
- â Efficient database indexes on lookup fields
- â Bulk sync operations with proper error handling
- â Provider data cached on client side

**Minor Optimizations:**
- ð¡ Institution logos could be cached via CDN (low priority)
- ð¡ Consider Redis for OAuth state storage in high-traffic scenarios

### Files Modified During Review

**Security fixes applied:**
1. `src/lib/crypto.ts` - Complete rewrite of encryption/decryption methods
2. `src/app/api/accounts/connect/route.ts` - Removed auth bypass

**Action Required:** Dev to update File List in Dev Agent Record with these QA modifications

### Requirements Traceability

All 9 Acceptance Criteria mapped to implementation with test coverage:

| AC | Requirement | Status | Tests | Coverage |
|----|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | TrueLayer SDK integration | â COVERED | Unit tests (23) | Excellent |
| 2 | OAuth flow | â COVERED | Unit + Integration | Good |
| 3 | Institution search | â COVERED | Unit tests | Good |
| 4 | Secure token storage | â COVERED | Indirect via integration | Good (now secure) |
| 5 | Connection status display | â COVERED | Component tests | Adequate |
| 6 | Error handling | â COVERED | Unit tests (9 scenarios) | Excellent |
| 7 | Manual entry fallback | â COVERED | Component tests | Adequate |
| 8 | Connection testing | â COVERED | Sandbox testing | Good |
| 9 | 6-hour data aggregation | â ï¸ PARTIAL | Unit tests only | **Cron missing** |

**Coverage Gap:** AC 9 has the service implemented but lacks the scheduled cron job for automatic 6-hour syncing.

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage:** 70% (adequate but improvable)
- â **Unit Tests:** 23 tests covering TrueLayer service core methods
- â **Integration Tests:** OAuth flow with mocked API responses
- â **Component Tests:** UI components for accounts
- â ï¸ **E2E Tests:** Missing complete user journey tests
- â ï¸ **Test Data:** Using correct mocks but incorrect endpoint URLs in assertions

**Test Quality Issues:**
1. Test assertions use `api.truelayer-sandbox.com/auth` but actual code uses `auth.truelayer.com`
2. E2E test file referenced in story but not implemented
3. No tests for encrypted token migration after crypto changes

**Recommendations:**
- Add E2E tests for: Connect â Auth â Callback â Sync â Display
- Fix endpoint URLs in test assertions (lines 35, 40, 78 in truelayer-service.test.ts)
- Add crypto service unit tests with test vectors

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** â docs/qa/gates/2.1-truelayer-integration-setup.yml

**Decision Rationale:**
- â All critical security issues **fixed during review**
- â Implementation quality is excellent
- â ï¸ Crypto changes require database token re-encryption before production
- â ï¸ Missing E2E tests for complete workflows
- â ï¸ Cron job for AC 9 not yet implemented
- â ï¸ Test assertions need URL corrections

**Quality Score:** 70/100
- Deducted 30 points for security concerns (now addressed but need deployment actions)

**Gate files created:**
- Quality Gate: `docs/qa/gates/2.1-truelayer-integration-setup.yml`

   - All test assertions updated to use `auth.truelayer.com`
   - Provider API endpoints corrected
   - Test mocks match actual TrueLayer API structure

6. **Code Duplication (ARCH-001):** â ELIMINATED
   - Token refresh logic extracted to `src/lib/token-refresh-utils.ts`
   - Shared utilities: `getValidAccessToken()`, `refreshAndUpdateToken()`
   - DRY principle applied, maintainability improved

7. **AC 9 - Cron Job (AC-009):** â IMPLEMENTED
   - **6-hour sync cron:** `src/app/api/cron/sync-accounts/route.ts`
   - **OAuth cleanup cron:** `src/app/api/cron/cleanup-oauth-states/route.ts`
   - Both configured in `vercel.json` with `CRON_SECRET` protection
   - Rate limiting: 1-second delay between accounts

### â Environment Configuration

8. **Configuration Complete:** â VERIFIED
   - `.env.local.example` updated with all required variables
   - `vercel.json` includes all TrueLayer + security env vars
   - Cron schedules configured: OAuth cleanup (2am daily), sync (every 6 hours)
   - Documentation updated with deployment steps

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, complete these steps:

1. **Run Token Migration Script:**
   ```bash
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxx ENCRYPTION_SALT=xxx npx tsx scripts/migrate-encrypted-tokens.ts
   ```

2. **Configure Production Environment (Vercel):**
   - â `ENCRYPTION_SALT` - Generate unique salt for production
   - â `CRON_SECRET` - Generate secure random secret
   - â `TRUELAYER_CLIENT_ID` / `TRUELAYER_CLIENT_SECRET` - Production credentials
   - â Verify all other env vars from `vercel.json`

3. **Enable Cron Jobs in Vercel Dashboard:**
   - â Confirm `/api/cron/cleanup-oauth-states` (daily at 2am)
   - â Confirm `/api/cron/sync-accounts` (every 6 hours)

4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
   - Monitor token refresh success rates (target: >99%)
   - Watch for TrueLayer API rate limit errors
   - Track sync failures and connection expirations
   - Verify cron jobs execute on schedule
