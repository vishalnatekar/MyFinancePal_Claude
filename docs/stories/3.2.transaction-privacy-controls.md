# Story 3.2: Transaction Privacy Controls

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to control which of my transactions are visible to household members,
**so that** I can share relevant expenses (like groceries) while keeping personal expenses (like bars) private.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Manual toggle for individual transactions to mark as shared/private
2. Clear visual indicators on transactions showing sharing status (shared/private)
3. Shared transactions visible in household members' "Household View"
4. Private transactions remain hidden from household members
5. Bulk operations to mark multiple transactions as shared/private
6. Transaction sharing status persists across account syncs
7. Filter transactions by sharing status (show all/shared only/private only)
8. Transaction sharing audit log tracking who shared what and when
9. Shared transactions display owner information in household view

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 (Household Creation and Invitation System) established the household infrastructure. Key learnings:
- Household membership is tracked via household_members table with user_id and household_id
- RLS policies use auth.uid() for authentication checks
- Use Zod schemas for all API validation
- Email notifications via Resend service for household events
- Testing pyramid: unit tests → integration tests → E2E tests
- Security definer functions prevent RLS infinite recursion issues (see migration 005)

### Core Privacy Model

**Transaction-Level Privacy (Not Account-Level)**:
The privacy model operates at the transaction level, not the account level. This allows users to:
- Connect their checking account once
- Share grocery transactions from that account with household
- Keep bar/entertainment transactions from the same account private
- Maintain granular control over what household members see

**Example User Flow**:
1. User connects Barclays checking account via TrueLayer
2. TrueLayer syncs 50 transactions from last month
3. User reviews transactions and marks 15 as "shared" (groceries, utilities)
4. Household members see only those 15 shared transactions
5. Remaining 35 transactions stay private (personal spending)

### Data Models

**Transactions Table - Extended Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#transactions-table]:

Existing fields:
- id: UUID primary key
- account_id: UUID REFERENCES financial_accounts(id)
- truelayer_transaction_id: TEXT (external API identifier)
- amount: DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL
- merchant_name: TEXT
- category: TEXT
- date: DATE NOT NULL
- description: TEXT
- is_shared_expense: BOOLEAN DEFAULT false (existing field for marking shared status)
- splitting_rule_id: UUID (for automatic rule-based sharing in Epic 4)
- manual_override: BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
- created_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

**New fields to add in migration 008**:
- shared_with_household_id: UUID REFERENCES households(id) ON DELETE SET NULL (nullable - null means private)
- shared_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (when transaction was shared)
- shared_by: UUID REFERENCES users(id) (who initiated sharing)

**Transaction Sharing History Table** (New - to be created):
- id: UUID primary key (auto-generated)
- transaction_id: UUID REFERENCES transactions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL
- household_id: UUID REFERENCES households(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL
- action: TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('shared', 'unshared'))
- changed_by: UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL
- changed_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()

**TypeScript Interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction]:

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  account_id: string;
  truelayer_transaction_id?: string;
  amount: number;
  merchant_name: string;
  category: string;
  date: string;
  description?: string;
  is_shared_expense: boolean;
  shared_with_household_id?: string; // NEW: which household sees this
  shared_at?: string; // NEW: when it was shared
  shared_by?: string; // NEW: who shared it
  splitting_rule_id?: string;
  manual_override: boolean;
  created_at: string;
}

interface TransactionSharingHistory {
  id: string;
  transaction_id: string;
  household_id: string;
  action: 'shared' | 'unshared';
  changed_by: string;
  changed_at: string;
}

// Extended type for household view with owner info
interface SharedTransactionWithOwner extends Transaction {
  owner_name: string;
  owner_email: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Transaction Sharing Endpoints** (New - to be created):

- **PUT /api/transactions/[id]/sharing** - Share/unshare single transaction
  - Request body: `{ household_id: string | null, is_shared: boolean }`
  - Authentication: Required (must own transaction's account)
  - Validation: User must be member of target household
  - Updates: is_shared_expense, shared_with_household_id, shared_at, shared_by
  - Creates entry in transaction_sharing_history
  - Returns updated transaction

- **POST /api/transactions/bulk-sharing** - Bulk sharing operations
  - Request body: `{ transaction_ids: string[], household_id: string | null, is_shared: boolean }`
  - Authentication: Required (must own all transactions)
  - Validation: All transactions must belong to user's accounts
  - Creates audit log entries for each transaction
  - Returns: `{ success_count: number, failed_count: number, errors: string[] }`

- **GET /api/transactions/[id]/sharing-history** - Retrieve audit log
  - Query params: `?household_id=uuid&start_date=YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Authentication: Required (must own transaction or be household member)
  - Returns paginated history with user details

**Updated Household Dashboard Endpoint**:
- **GET /api/dashboard/household/[id]/transactions** - Get shared transactions
  - Authentication: Required (must be household member)
  - Returns transactions where shared_with_household_id = [id]
  - Includes owner information (JOIN with users table)
  - Ordered by date DESC
  - Pagination support: `?page=1&limit=50`

**Existing Transaction List Endpoint Update**:
- **GET /api/transactions** - Get user's transactions
  - Add query param: `?sharing_status=all|shared|private`
  - Filter by is_shared_expense when sharing_status provided
  - Returns user's own transactions with sharing metadata

**Authentication Requirements** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]:
All endpoints require bearerAuth security with JWT tokens from Supabase Auth. Call authenticateRequest() helper first.

### RLS Policy Updates

**Transactions Table - Updated Policies** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#row-level-security-policies]:

Current policy allows viewing shared transactions based on is_shared_expense. This needs refinement:

```sql
-- Replace existing "Users can view shared transactions" policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view shared transactions" ON public.transactions
  FOR SELECT USING (
    is_shared_expense = true
    AND shared_with_household_id IS NOT NULL
    AND shared_with_household_id IN (
      SELECT household_id FROM public.household_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Existing policy for own transactions (keep as is)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own transactions" ON public.transactions
  FOR SELECT USING (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.financial_accounts
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Update management policy to only allow owner to modify
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own transactions" ON public.transactions
  FOR ALL USING (
    account_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.financial_accounts
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Key RLS Considerations**:
- Users see their own transactions regardless of sharing status
- Users see shared transactions ONLY from households they belong to
- Users cannot modify other users' transactions (even if shared)
- Setting shared_with_household_id = NULL effectively unshares transaction

### Component Specifications

**Database Migration**:
- `database/migrations/008_transaction_sharing_controls.sql` - Schema changes for transaction sharing

### UI/UX Specifications

**Transaction Row Component Enhancement**:
Each transaction row in the transaction list should display:
- Transaction details (merchant, amount, date) - existing
- **NEW: Sharing status badge**
  - Private: Gray badge with lock icon "Private"
  - Shared: Green badge with users icon "Shared with [Household Name]"
  - Position: Right side of transaction row, before amount
- **NEW: Quick share toggle** (hover or always visible)
  - Click to open sharing dropdown
  - Select household to share with (if multiple households)
  - Toggle switch: Share/Private

**Bulk Sharing Operations UI**:
- Checkbox column at left of transaction table for multi-select
- Toolbar appears when >0 transactions selected
- Toolbar shows: "[X] transactions selected" + household dropdown + "Share" / "Make Private" buttons
- Confirmation dialog: "Share 5 transactions with Family household?"
- Progress indicator during bulk operation
- Success toast: "5 transactions shared successfully"

**Sharing Status Filter**:
- Dropdown filter at top of transactions page
- Options: "All Transactions" (default), "Shared Only", "Private Only"
- Badge count: "Shared (12)" "Private (38)"
- Persists filter selection in URL query param

**Household View - Shared Transactions Section**:
- New section on household dashboard: "Shared Transactions"
- Table columns: Date, Owner, Merchant, Category, Amount, Shared By/When
- Owner column shows avatar + name (e.g., "John's transaction")
- Tooltip on hover showing when it was shared
- Filter by member: "Show transactions from: All Members / John / Sarah"
- Sort by: Date (default), Amount, Owner

### Real-time Updates

When a household member shares a transaction, other household members should see it appear in real-time:

**Implementation** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#real-time-subscriptions]:
- Use Supabase real-time subscriptions on transactions table
- Filter subscriptions by shared_with_household_id matching current household
- Update household dashboard automatically when transactions are shared
- Show toast notification: "John shared a new grocery transaction"

**Hook implementation**:
```typescript
// In src/hooks/use-shared-transactions.ts
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel(`household-${householdId}-transactions`)
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'transactions',
      filter: `shared_with_household_id=eq.${householdId}`
    }, handleTransactionShared)
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [householdId]);
```

### Privacy Considerations

**What Household Members See**:
- Only transactions explicitly shared by owner
- Owner's name/avatar for attribution
- Full transaction details: merchant, amount, date, category
- Cannot see owner's account balance or other private transactions

**What Remains Private**:
- All non-shared transactions from the same account
- Account balance (until Story 3.3 if needed)
- Transaction descriptions if sensitive
- Other accounts not involved in shared transactions

**Sharing Guardrails**:
- Cannot share transaction to household you don't belong to
- Cannot share other users' transactions
- Unsharing removes transaction from household view immediately
- Leaving household automatically unshares all your transactions from that household

### Migration Strategy

**Handling Existing is_shared_expense Field**:
The transactions table already has `is_shared_expense: BOOLEAN`. Migration 008 should:
1. Add new fields: shared_with_household_id, shared_at, shared_by
2. For existing transactions where is_shared_expense = true, set shared_with_household_id to first household user belongs to
3. Set shared_at = created_at for migrated records
4. Set shared_by = account owner for migrated records
5. Keep is_shared_expense field as it's also used by splitting rules (Epic 4)

**Field Relationship**:
- `is_shared_expense`: Boolean flag indicating transaction is/was shared (used by splitting engine)
- `shared_with_household_id`: Specific household that can see this transaction (privacy control)
- Both fields work together: is_shared_expense = true AND shared_with_household_id = [uuid]

### Bridge to Epic 4 (Expense Splitting)

This story establishes manual transaction sharing. Epic 4 will build on this foundation:
- **Story 4.1**: Create splitting rules (e.g., "All Tesco → shared with Family")
- **Story 4.2**: Auto-mark transactions as shared based on rules (auto-sets shared_with_household_id)
- **Story 4.3**: Calculate settlement amounts based on shared transactions

The manual controls from Story 3.2 will serve as:
- Override mechanism when rules incorrectly categorize transactions
- Initial sharing method before users set up rules
- Training data for understanding which transactions are typically shared

### Technical Constraints

**Authentication** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]:
- All API routes must call authenticateRequest() helper first
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and JWT validation

**Input Validation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Use Zod schemas for all API endpoints and form submissions
- Validate household_id exists and user is member
- Validate transaction_id exists and user owns the account

**Database Access** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Always use Supabase client with Row Level Security policies
- Never use raw SQL queries in API routes
- Test RLS policies prevent cross-household data leaks

**State Management** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Use Zustand actions for all state modifications
- Update transaction-store.ts with sharing control actions

### Testing

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

**Frontend Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/components/transactions/`
- Test files:
  - `transaction-sharing-toggle.test.tsx` - Test toggle component state changes
  - `bulk-transaction-sharing-controls.test.tsx` - Test multi-select and bulk operations
  - `sharing-status-filter.test.tsx` - Test filter dropdown behavior
  - `transaction-sharing-history.test.tsx` - Test audit log display

**Backend Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/api/transactions/`
- Test files:
  - `sharing.test.ts` - Test PUT /api/transactions/[id]/sharing endpoint
  - `bulk-sharing.test.ts` - Test POST /api/transactions/bulk-sharing endpoint
  - `sharing-history.test.ts` - Test GET /api/transactions/[id]/sharing-history endpoint
  - `household-transactions.test.ts` - Test GET /api/dashboard/household/[id]/transactions
- Test RLS policies with different household memberships

**Integration Tests**:
- Test sharing flow: user shares transaction → household member sees it
- Test privacy: user shares transaction → non-member cannot see it
- Test unsharing: remove shared_with_household_id → transaction disappears from household view
- Test audit log creation for all sharing actions
- Test real-time updates when sharing status changes

**E2E Tests**:
- Location: `tests/e2e/core-workflows/`
- Test file: `transaction-privacy-controls.spec.ts`
- Test complete workflow:
  1. User connects account and syncs transactions
  2. User marks Tesco transaction as shared with "Family" household
  3. Verify household member (partner) sees transaction in household view
  4. User marks bar transaction as private (or leaves it unshared)
  5. Verify household member does NOT see private transaction
  6. User bulk-shares 5 grocery transactions
  7. Verify all 5 appear in household view
  8. User unshares 1 transaction
  9. Verify it disappears from household view
  10. Check audit log shows all sharing actions

**Security Testing**:
- Verify users cannot share transactions from accounts they don't own
- Test RLS policies prevent viewing transactions from wrong household
- Verify sharing_with_household_id validation prevents cross-household sharing
- Test bulk operations cannot affect other users' transactions
- Verify leaving household removes access to that user's shared transactions

**Edge Cases to Test**:
- Sharing transaction to household user doesn't belong to (should fail)
- Sharing already-shared transaction to different household
- Bulk sharing with mix of valid/invalid transactions
- Unsharing transaction that was never shared
- Viewing shared transactions after being removed from household
- Account deletion cascades to transaction sharing history

✅ **Authorization**: Ownership validation prevents users from sharing others' transactions
✅ **RLS Policies**: Transaction-level privacy enforced at database layer
✅ **Household Membership**: Sharing restricted to households user belongs to
✅ **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all user inputs
✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: Using Supabase client (no raw SQL)
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all sharing actions with timestamps

**Security Functions Implemented:**
- `update_transaction_sharing()`: SECURITY DEFINER function with ownership checks
- `bulk_update_transaction_sharing()`: Per-transaction error handling prevents partial failures

**No security vulnerabilities identified.**

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✅ PASS**

Performance optimizations implemented:

✅ **Database Indexes**: Added covering indexes for common queries
- `idx_transactions_shared_with_household` on (shared_with_household_id, date DESC)
- `idx_transactions_is_shared_expense` on (is_shared_expense, date DESC)
- `idx_sharing_history_transaction_id` on (transaction_id, changed_at DESC)

✅ **Pagination**: Household transactions API implements limit/offset pagination
✅ **Real-time Subscriptions**: Properly scoped to specific household ID to reduce bandwidth
✅ **Efficient Queries**: Uses JOINs appropriately, no N+1 query patterns detected

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - as per review-story task guidelines, I identified improvements but did not modify code. The codebase quality is good and all issues are non-blocking.

  - File: `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`
  - **Impact**: Low - Nice to have for better error UX
  - **Effort**: Medium - 2-3 hours

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/3.2-transaction-privacy-controls.yml

**Quality Score**: 82/100

**Status Reason**: Implementation is functionally complete with excellent test coverage and security practices, but UX can be improved by replacing browser alert() with toast notifications. All core functionality works correctly and is safe for production deployment.

### Recommended Status

**✅ Ready for Done** (with advisory improvements tracked)

The story owner can confidently move this to Done status. The identified concerns are minor UX and code quality improvements that don't block production deployment. They can be addressed in a future maintenance story or as part of general codebase improvements.

**Advisory**: Consider creating a follow-up tech debt story for the toast notification implementation, as this would benefit the entire application, not just transaction sharing.
