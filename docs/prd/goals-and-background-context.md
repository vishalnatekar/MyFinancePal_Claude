# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable 10,000+ UK households to automate expense sharing without sacrificing financial privacy
- Provide comprehensive net worth tracking across all account types via third-party aggregation
- Eliminate manual expense reconciliation saving users 2+ hours monthly per household
- Establish privacy-first household finance platform supporting couples, flatmates, and families
- Achieve Â£50k ARR within 18 months through freemium-to-premium conversion
- Build competitive moat through unique combination of aggregation + household sharing

## Background Context

MyFinancePal addresses a significant gap in the UK personal finance market where existing solutions force users to choose between financial privacy and expense convenience. Current solutions like Lumio only serve couples, while aggregators like Emma lack household features entirely. The combination of mature Open Banking infrastructure and growing demand for shared financial management creates an optimal market opportunity.

The privacy-first approach differentiates MyFinancePal by allowing selective account sharing - partners can collaborate on expenses while maintaining individual investment privacy. This addresses the core tension preventing adoption of existing joint finance solutions.
