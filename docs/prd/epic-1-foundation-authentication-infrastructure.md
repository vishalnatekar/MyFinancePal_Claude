# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish a secure, production-ready foundation with Google SSO authentication, basic user management, and deployment infrastructure. This epic delivers a functional authenticated web application that validates the core technical stack and provides the platform for all future features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured development environment with CI/CD pipeline,
so that I can develop features efficiently with automated testing and deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monorepo structure established with frontend (Next.js/React) and backend (Node.js/Express) packages
2. TypeScript configuration across both frontend and backend
3. PostgreSQL database setup with migration scripts
4. Redis configuration for session management
5. ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality
6. Git repository with initial commit and branch protection rules
7. Basic CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
8. Environment configuration for development, staging, and production

## Story 1.2: Google SSO Authentication Implementation

As a user,
I want to sign up and log in using my Google account,
so that I can access the application securely without creating new passwords.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Google OAuth 2.0 integration configured with proper scopes
2. "Sign in with Google" button prominently displayed on landing page
3. Successful authentication creates user record in database
4. JWT token generation and secure storage in httpOnly cookies
5. Session management with automatic token refresh
6. Logout functionality that clears all authentication tokens
7. Error handling for OAuth failures and network issues
8. Redirect to appropriate page after successful authentication

## Story 1.3: Basic User Profile and Dashboard

As a authenticated user,
I want to see my profile information and a basic dashboard,
so that I can confirm my account is working and navigate the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User profile page displaying Google account information (name, email)
2. Basic dashboard layout with navigation structure
3. Secure route protection - unauthenticated users redirected to login
4. User session persistence across browser sessions
5. Responsive design working on mobile and desktop
6. Basic navigation menu with placeholder links for future features
7. "My Finances" and "Household" tab structure established
8. User can update basic preferences (email notifications, timezone)
