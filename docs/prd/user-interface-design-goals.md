# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, trustworthy interface that prioritizes financial data clarity and privacy controls. The design should feel secure and professional while remaining approachable for everyday users. Emphasis on progressive disclosure - show simple overviews first, detailed data on demand. Privacy-first design with clear visual indicators of what's shared vs private.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Tab-based navigation** between "My Finances" and "Household" views to maintain privacy separation
- **One-click sharing controls** with clear toggle states for account visibility
- **Rule-based automation setup** through guided workflows rather than complex configuration
- **Progressive onboarding** starting with single account connection, expanding gradually
- **Notification-driven transparency** keeping household members informed of shared expenses

## Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard (Individual)** - Net worth overview, account summaries, recent transactions
- **Dashboard (Household)** - Shared expenses, settlement status, household member activity
- **Account Management** - Connect accounts, sharing controls, sync status
- **Expense Rules** - Configure splitting rules, merchant categorization, splitting percentages
- **Settlement Center** - Current balances, settlement history, mark-as-paid functionality
- **Account Connection Flow** - Google SSO, Yodlee OAuth, manual entry fallback

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure compliance with WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast ratios for financial data readability.

## Branding
Clean, modern financial technology aesthetic. Trustworthy color palette emphasizing security (blues, grays) with accent colors for positive actions (greens for settlements, gentle notifications). Minimal visual complexity to focus attention on financial data accuracy.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive design optimized for smartphones and tablets, with enhanced desktop experience. Progressive Web App capabilities for app-like mobile experience without native app complexity.
