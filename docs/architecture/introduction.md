# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **MyFinancePal**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template Assessment

Based on your PRD analysis, MyFinancePal appears to be a **greenfield project** with specific technology preferences outlined (React/Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database).

**Decision:** Greenfield project with AI-optimized technology stack for maximum development velocity and agent success.
