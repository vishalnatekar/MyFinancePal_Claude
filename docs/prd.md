# MyFinancePal Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable 10,000+ UK households to automate expense sharing without sacrificing financial privacy
- Provide comprehensive net worth tracking across all account types via third-party aggregation
- Eliminate manual expense reconciliation saving users 2+ hours monthly per household
- Establish privacy-first household finance platform supporting couples, flatmates, and families
- Achieve Â£50k ARR within 18 months through freemium-to-premium conversion
- Build competitive moat through unique combination of aggregation + household sharing

### Background Context

MyFinancePal addresses a significant gap in the UK personal finance market where existing solutions force users to choose between financial privacy and expense convenience. Current solutions like Lumio only serve couples, while aggregators like Emma lack household features entirely. The combination of mature Open Banking infrastructure and growing demand for shared financial management creates an optimal market opportunity.

The privacy-first approach differentiates MyFinancePal by allowing selective account sharing - partners can collaborate on expenses while maintaining individual investment privacy. This addresses the core tension preventing adoption of existing joint finance solutions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, trustworthy interface that prioritizes financial data clarity and privacy controls. The design should feel secure and professional while remaining approachable for everyday users. Emphasis on progressive disclosure - show simple overviews first, detailed data on demand. Privacy-first design with clear visual indicators of what's shared vs private.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Tab-based navigation** between "My Finances" and "Household" views to maintain privacy separation
- **One-click sharing controls** with clear toggle states for account visibility
- **Rule-based automation setup** through guided workflows rather than complex configuration
- **Progressive onboarding** starting with single account connection, expanding gradually
- **Notification-driven transparency** keeping household members informed of shared expenses

### Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard (Individual)** - Net worth overview, account summaries, recent transactions
- **Dashboard (Household)** - Shared expenses, settlement status, household member activity
- **Account Management** - Connect accounts, sharing controls, sync status
- **Expense Rules** - Configure splitting rules, merchant categorization, splitting percentages
- **Settlement Center** - Current balances, settlement history, mark-as-paid functionality
- **Account Connection Flow** - Google SSO, Yodlee OAuth, manual entry fallback

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure compliance with WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast ratios for financial data readability.

### Branding
Clean, modern financial technology aesthetic. Trustworthy color palette emphasizing security (blues, grays) with accent colors for positive actions (greens for settlements, gentle notifications). Minimal visual complexity to focus attention on financial data accuracy.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive design optimized for smartphones and tablets, with enhanced desktop experience. Progressive Web App capabilities for app-like mobile experience without native app complexity.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing frontend and backend packages with shared utilities. Enables coordinated deployments and shared component libraries while maintaining clear separation between services.

### Service Architecture
**Monolithic backend** initially with well-defined internal service boundaries for future extraction. Core services include: Authentication Service, Account Aggregation Service, Household Management Service, Expense Splitting Engine, and Settlement Tracking Service. This approach reduces operational complexity while maintaining clean architecture for scaling.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing** with focus on financial calculation accuracy and API integration reliability. Automated testing for expense splitting rules, settlement calculations, and data aggregation flows. Manual testing for OAuth flows and third-party API edge cases.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js for SSR capabilities and SEO optimization, TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend Technology:** Node.js with Express framework for rapid development and JavaScript ecosystem consistency
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for transactional integrity with Redis for session management and caching
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0 integration with JWT token management
- **Third-party Integration:** Yodlee or Plaid SDK for financial data aggregation with fallback manual entry
- **Hosting:** AWS or Vercel deployment with UK data residency for compliance
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, secure API key management
- **Monitoring:** Application performance monitoring and error tracking for financial data accuracy
- **API Design:** RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation for future integration possibilities
