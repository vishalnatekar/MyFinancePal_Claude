    status: PASS
    notes: |
      All CRITICAL issues resolved during review cycle:
      - Token enumeration attack vector (HIGH risk → MITIGATED)
      - Duplicate invitation bypass bug (MEDIUM risk → FIXED)
      - Frontend now uses secure API schema (VERIFIED)

      Security posture:
      - Cryptographically secure token generation (crypto.randomUUID)
      - Comprehensive RLS policies with security definer function
      - IP-based rate limiting on unauthenticated endpoints
      - Data minimization enforced (no internal IDs exposed)
      - Email verification enforced in accept flow
      - 7-day expiry with auto-expiration logic

      Acceptable trade-offs:
      - Tokens stored in plaintext (acceptable for short-lived invitations)
      - Email enumeration possible (standard behavior, low risk)

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Database indexes properly configured (token, email, household_id, status)
      - Non-blocking email sends prevent API bottlenecks
      - Efficient RLS policy queries
      - Rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion

      Minor optimization opportunities:
      - Email batch notifications use sequential loop (low priority)
      - Could benefit from caching household details (low priority)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Email failures logged but don't fail invitation creation
      - Proper error handling with try/catch in all API routes
      - Database constraints enforce data integrity
      - Invitation expiry auto-updates on access
      - Resend limits (3 max) prevent spam

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Clean separation of concerns (service layer, email templates)
      - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
      - Proper Zod validation schemas
      - Well-documented migrations with clear RLS policies
      - Component architecture follows project standards

      Minor issues:
      - 9 'any' type assertions noted (Supabase TypeScript limitations)
      - Email service config could be extracted to dedicated file

  INITIAL REVIEW (2025-10-08 13:00):
  - Implementation quality GOOD with solid architecture
  - CRITICAL security vulnerabilities discovered and fixed by QA:
    1. Token enumeration attack vector (HIGH risk → MITIGATED)
    2. Broken member validation query (MEDIUM risk → FIXED)
  - Security fixes introduced breaking API change
  - E2E test missing
  - Initial Gate: CONCERNS

  RE-REVIEW (2025-10-08 14:30):
  - P0 frontend compatibility fix VERIFIED (lines 131-133)
  - P1 E2E test suite VERIFIED (509 lines, 6 comprehensive scenarios)
  - All acceptance criteria implemented and tested end-to-end
  - Security posture excellent with defense-in-depth
  - Test pyramid complete (unit + integration + E2E)
  - Updated Gate: PASS ✅

  FINAL GATE DECISION: PASS
  - All critical security issues resolved
  - Frontend compatibility verified in production code
  - Complete test coverage across all levels
  - Production-ready code quality
  - No outstanding concerns

  QUALITY SCORE: 95/100
  - Original implementation: ~85 (excellent foundation)
  - Security hardening: +10 (comprehensive fixes)
  - Complete test coverage: +5 (E2E tests added)
  - Minor optimization opportunities: -5 (email batching, caching)

  OUTSTANDING WORK: Rapid response to QA feedback with thorough fixes.
  The invitation system demonstrates excellent engineering: secure by design,
  comprehensive testing, and maintainable architecture. This feature sets a
  high bar for quality and is ready for production deployment.
