    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      FIXED CRITICAL ISSUES:
      - ✅ Upgraded from insecure createCipher to secure createCipheriv with GCM auth tags
      - ✅ Removed development auth bypass that could leak to production
      - ✅ Implemented environment-specific salt for key derivation

      REMAINING CONCERNS:
      - ⚠️ Existing encrypted tokens in DB need re-encryption with new crypto implementation
      - ⚠️ OAuth state cleanup cron job not implemented (memory leak risk)
      - ✅ OAuth CSRF protection properly implemented with state tokens
      - ✅ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (10 req/min connect, 20 req/min callback)
      - ✅ RLS policies properly configured for financial_accounts table
      - ✅ Access tokens stored encrypted at rest

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ Sequential account sync with 1s delay to respect rate limits
      - ✅ Database indexes on critical lookup fields (truelayer_connection_id, user_id)
      - ✅ Efficient bulk sync implementation with proper error handling
      - ✅ Provider list caching through client-side state management
      - ⚠️ No CDN caching for institution logos (minor optimization opportunity)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
      - ✅ Token refresh logic with fallback for expired connections
      - ✅ Retry mechanisms implicit through manual re-sync capability
      - ✅ Sync history tracking for debugging and auditing
      - ✅ Circuit breaker pattern via rate limiting
      - ✅ Graceful degradation to manual entry when connections fail

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ Clean separation: types, services, API routes, components
      - ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript types for TrueLayer API
      - ✅ Service layer abstraction (TrueLayerService class)
      - ✅ Consistent error handling patterns across routes
      - ✅ Well-documented security fixes with inline comments
      - ⚠️ Minor code duplication in token refresh logic (low priority)
