story_title: "Household Dashboard and Shared View"
gate: "PASS"
gate_conditional: "Test coverage required before production deployment"
status_reason: "EXCELLENT code quality with proper TypeScript type safety, optimized performance, enhanced privacy model, and multi-currency support. ONLY remaining requirement: add test suite per testing-strategy.md."

top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"

resolved_issues:
  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "RESOLVED - Added proper TypeScript interfaces (HouseholdMemberRow, FinancialAccountRow, TransactionRow)"
    resolution: "All any types eliminated with compile-time type safety"
  - id: "CODE-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "RESOLVED - Replaced forEach with for...of loops"
    resolution: "Lines 261 and 281 now use performant for...of pattern"
  - id: "CODE-003"
    severity: medium
    finding: "RESOLVED - Fixed non-null assertions"
    resolution: "Using proper type assertion 'as string' instead of '!' operator"
  - id: "PERF-001"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ Authentication via withHouseholdAuth, RLS policies enforced, input validation with Zod. ✅ Enhanced privacy: transactions filtered by is_shared_expense and shared_with_household_id. Minor recommendation: add user preference for hiding transaction amounts in feed (non-blocking)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ Single profile fetch (no duplication), ✅ for...of loops for better performance, ✅ Proper type casting eliminates runtime checks. Minor recommendation: add debouncing on real-time updates (non-blocking)."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "⚠️ No test coverage to verify error handling and edge cases - ONLY REMAINING CONCERN"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "✅ ALL linting violations resolved (except 2 in unrelated PendingInvitations component), ✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces, ✅ Clean code structure, ✅ Comprehensive documentation"
